No matter what other people say, consoles come down to personal preference, but in most parties is apples and oranges. It comes down to whether you prefer higher quality graphics, the "home" good feeling (PC gamers want expensive gear to be more of a compromise of price/quality, and people with giant TVs probably like hating on stuff rather than using their laptop), the comfort/portability of the phone, etc. Ranking is important too, and what makes sense. Just saying "Hey, I'm going to buy my kids a gaming platform for Christmas!" is important, but knowing who those people are, why, and what they prefer is normal. 

TL;DR: What game kid should you get? Vitas aren't exactly popular on this sub, so you should know other stuff too.
