Some insulting plot to prove a rather wishy-washy point. 

Any old exceptional cause to reach your decision is chosen until you catch enough bad guys. Guess what? You never buy for yourself becoming convinced. You just *do* it. Because there is too much *anyway*. 

&gt;Except that the people being stopped are mostly black men 

That's what I'd *like* to say. I don't, because 

a) there is a third party that is spending their time and resources on telling us the opposite 

b) when we cannot know what happens on freeways and highways without any controls, we'll just have very short, pretentious sound bytes being shouted in our ears whenever a story blows up. 

c) those "black men" being stopped could be entirely innocent with a truly random set of lot-driving circumstances, it could be true that this is a political fear tactic that our government has been flourishing for years already, that being stopped by police is completely harmless and happens for all people of all races for all kinds of reasons.   

None of that will ever be "known" by the majority of public, because we only get to be told *what the alternative suggests*. 

This critique we are having in the comment section right here is good and should always be available, should be spread and echoed by everybody in discussions *like this*. People should understand though, that this form of streaming skepticism will hardly ever be enough to determine some true fact.
