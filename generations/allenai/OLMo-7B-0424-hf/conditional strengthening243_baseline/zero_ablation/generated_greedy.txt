Q: How to get the value of a variable in a function in PHP? I have a function that is called from a form.
function get_value($var) {
    $var = $_POST[$var];
    return $var;
}

I want to get the value of the variable $var in the function.
I tried this:
$var = get_value('var');

But it doesn't work.

A: You can't do that.
The function is called with a parameter, and the parameter is assigned to the variable.
You can't access the variable outside the function.
